### How to use the app

The YR Headwaters app is a simple Shiny app that enables users to visualize various statistics summarized at the watershed level. The app consists of 2 main sections: 1) the sidebar panel and the main panel.

**Sidebar panel**

The sidebar panel allows the user to view different indicators using a choice of legend types, color schemes, and opacity. The user can also download the geopackage file to their computer.

**Main panel**

The main panel consists of 3 tabs on the left side (Layer, Attributes, Help) and one tab on the right.

Left side tabs:

- Layer tab - this is a map viewer. Layers can be turned on and off by selecting them in the legend. The map and legend will change as the user select different indicators, legend type, color scheme, and opacity.
- Attributes tab - this is a table listing all attributes available within the geopackage. This table is static and will not change.
- Help tab - provides basic information for using the app.

Right side tabs:

- Indicators tab - describes attributes (indicators) for a polygon selected by the user.
